* Add Gesture : Users can add a gesture and define its name which will help others to identify the specific gesture .
* Remove Gesture : Users can remove a specific gesture which may be added wrong .

The Scope of project include the following : 

* Create sign language according to the user requirements .
* Delete any sign language by entering the gesture name .
* Proper Validation and success messages given to users on successful completion tasks.
* Allows to create and train the model .
* Users can test the project in testing mode which predicts signs which are created in the project by the user  .
* Simple user interface for easy interaction .
* No need to touch or press any keys while dataset creation .

Developer Requirements
* Python : Version 3.8.10
* Libraries: Numpy, Mediapipe, OpenCv-Python , tkinter ,pandas.
